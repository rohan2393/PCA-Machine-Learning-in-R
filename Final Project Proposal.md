# Climate Change
## Installations and Software Required
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Plotly

## System Requirements
Linux, Mac OS, Windows

## Type of Data Used for the analysis
Structured Dataset

## Idea

* The aim of this project is to develop a data visualization that best fits the Climate Change dataset recorded by Berkeley Earth, which is affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Berkeley Earth is a Berkeley, California based independent nonprofit focused on land temperature data analysis for climate science. * 
* Berkeley Earthâ€™s primary product is an analysis of summary air temperatures over land. *

## Input

* The source/input for this project is a dataset from http://berkeleyearth.org/data/. The following datasets are used for this project. *

* Global Average Land Temperature by Country (GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv) 
* Global Average Land Temperature by State (GlobalLandTemperaturesByState.csv) 
* Global Land Temperatures By Major City (GlobalLandTemperaturesByMajorCity.csv) 
* Global Land Temperatures By City (GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity.csv)

## Output

* A Time Series graph (Is there a global warming?)
* GIS Mapping of average temperatures in the countries.
* Forecasting Future Annual Temperature changes using machine learning techniques.


## Business Proposal
	
* Climate mapping and prediction for future projected changes in climate by using GIS data. GIS technology is useful for environment understanding, in strategic decision making and climate change monitoring also important in predictions of disaster risks in forest and agriculture sectors. Worldwide scientists, researchers, different policymakers rely on scientific analysis of GIS data and its database management functionality. This techniques can possible to provide GIS web based application for climate change detection and future climate predictions. GIS techniques includes, query making, GIS statistical functions which is applicable in Climate projections and also using GIS can possible to display in maps, graphs and charts viewing and analyzing purpose *

* This project involves the implementation of a time series data visualization which has many business applications in Finance, Sentimental Analysis and everything that has a time constraint involved in it. So this project is a basis for any project which involves time and hence we can apply the algorithm used in this project. *
